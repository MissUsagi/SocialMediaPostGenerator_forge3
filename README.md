# Social Media Post Generator with Chat Bot Assistant and Chrome Extension

This project was developed as part of my participation in the **Vue Forge3** event. The primary objective was to create a versatile social media post generator powered by **OpenAI**. With the assistance of AI, users can effortlessly generate engaging social media posts tailored to their needs.

**Key features of the project include:**
_Vue.js, Open AI, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, TypeScript, Cypress, Nuxt._

Throughout the development process, I had the opportunity to explore **Nuxt** for the first time. While navigating this new framework, I relied on the hints and code provided during the challenge.

As someone relatively new to **TypeScript** and **E2E testing**, this event served as a valuable learning experience. I embraced the opportunity to expand my skills in these areas and made significant progress with it.

Due to the immense potential of this project, I have decided to continue its development beyond the event. It is still a work in progress, with some components available only in my private repository. 
However, I will update it in the future.

Unfortunately, due to limitations with the available OpenAI tokens, I am unable to provide a live demo of the project at this time. :(
